# Natural Language Processing Projects
Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects completed through Coursera focusing on various aspects of NLP.

## Project 1: Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification
### Overview
The first project in this repository involves fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text classification tasks. Specifically, the goal is to classify questions from Quora and determine whether they are offensive or not.

### Description
Quora, being a platform for sharing knowledge and information, encounters a variety of questions. Some of these questions may contain offensive content, which can negatively impact user experience and community standards. To address this issue, this project leverages BERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to classify Quora questions and distinguish between offensive and non-offensive content.

### Goals
Utilize BERT for text classification tasks.
Train a classifier to categorize Quora questions into offensive and non-offensive categories.
Improve community standards and user experience on the Quora platform.
### Contents
Data: Contains datasets of Quora questions labeled as offensive or non-offensive.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
Results: Results and evaluation metrics of the trained BERT classifier.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter notebooks or scripts using your preferred development environment.
Follow the instructions provided within the notebooks/scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Requirements
Python (>=3.6)
Transformers library (>=4.0)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for viewing and running the notebooks)
Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib (for data processing and visualization)
